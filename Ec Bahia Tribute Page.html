      <h3 id="headline">Here's a timeline of Ec Bahia's History</h3>
<li><strong>1931</strong> - The Esporte Clube Bahia was founded in 1931, when players from two clubs decided to merge. The Associação Atlética da Bahia and the Clube Bahiano de Tênis had decided to discontinue their football divisions. In the club's first year, Bahia won the Torneio Inicio and Bahia State Championship.</li>
      <li><strong>1959</strong> - The club represented the state of Bahia in Taça Brasil (the precursor of the Brazilian Championship), winning the first Brazlian title in 1959 and finishing as runner-up in 1961 and 1963.</li>
      <li><strong>The 1980s </strong> - The 1980s were the best in Bahia's history. Bahia won their second national title in 1988, finishing 5th in 1986 and 4th in 1990.</li>
      <li><strong>The Dark years:</strong></li>
      <li>In 1997, Bahia was relegated to the Série B for the first time in its history after a 0–0 draw against the Juventude at the Fonte Nova stadium. In 1999 Bahia was close to being promoted to the Série A again. Bahia had a very good season, but finished in 3rd place, which was not enough to see them promoted.</li>
      <li>In 2000, due to bribery scandals involving clubs such as the São Paulo and the Internacional, the team returned to the Brazilian First Division, invited by the Clube dos 13, along with the Fluminense, which was made a scapegoat for the controversy and was nationally victimized by the media (see Copa João Havelange).</li>
      <li>In 2002 the bank that had sponsored the team went bankrupt and the Bahia began a descent down the Brazilian football pyramid. After the title of the Northeast Cup in 2001 and 2002, Bahia performed poorly in 2003, and were relegated to the Série B for the second time in the club's history. In 2004, the team was close to getting promoted to the Série A again, finishing 4th. In order to be promoted, Bahia would have to win the final match against the Brasiliense, but the referee Paulo César de Oliveira was assigned to that match and many people[who?] say he was all but fair on that day. In 2005, the club again competed in the Série B, finishing in 18th place, and was relegated to the Série C for the first time in the club's history.</li>
      <li><strong>Fênix tricolor (tricolored phoenix):</strong> </li>
      <li>Bahia finished 2007 among the first four teams of the Third Division, and were promoted to the Second Division for the 2008 season. The Bahia began strongly, but in the last game of the 3rd stage of the Série C against the already-eliminated Fast Club, Bahia needed a win to advance to the final. The victory came in the last minute of the game with a goal scored by Charles. In the final, the team finished the third division in 2nd place, only losing the title in the final round.[citation needed] This moment is called the "Fênix Tricolor" amongst Bahia fans.[citation needed] The phoenix represents Bahia rising from the ashes.</li>
      <li>Despite playing in the Third Division of Brazilian football in 2007, Bahia had the largest average attendance in Brazil: 40,400 people per match.[citation needed] No club in the Third, the Second, or even the First Division was able to match it.[citation needed] However, this is not unusual for Bahia, having also achieved the biggest average attendance in Brazil in 2004 (Second Division), 1988 (First Division), 1986 (First Division), and 1985 (First Division).</li>
      <li><strong>Recent years:</strong></li>
      <li>From 2010 to 2014 Bahia remained in the first division. In 2014 they were relegated to the second division again, but came back in 2016. In 2017 they are playing in the first division. After 22 years out of international competition, Bahia returned in 2012 when they qualified for the Copa Sul-americana. In addition, they have won the 2012, 2014 and 2015 Bahia State Championship and the Northeast Cup in 2017.</li>
      <li>In February 2018 the intense rivalry between Bahia and Esporte Clube Vitória drew international attention when ten players (five from each team) were shown the red card in a State Championship match.[2]</li>
